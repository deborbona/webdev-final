    <p> Hi there. I know that this is a difficult time for everyone in the world. Being stuck in quarantine is a different experience for everyone. Maybe it's new for you and you feel uncomfortable being alone and inside all day. If you're like me, maybe you'd be living this 'isolation' lifestyle regardless of the global pandemic. Either way, not knowing when you're next paycheck will come, not knowing when you'll get to reunite with a loved one, and all other uncertainties can be difficult to live with. There are many ways you might cope with these difficultiesâ€” cooking and baking is my personal favourite way to unplug from the rest of the world and spend peaceful time alone. Over the past few months I have been creating my own recipes that I would like to share with you. I have tried to make them as simple as possible for anyone and everyone to try at home. Some of these recipes are also marked as suitable for those with specific dietary restrictions.</p>
